ðŸ©º Maternal Health Risk Classification using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting the health risk levels of pregnant women based on various clinical parameters using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide early identification of maternal health risks to support better medical care and intervention.

We have implemented and compared multiple machine learning models including:

Random Forest (Primary Model)

Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel)

XGBoost

Decision Tree

Gaussian Naive Bayes

The dataset includes features such as age, blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. The models were trained and evaluated using Google Colab, and the best-performing model was selected based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

ðŸ“Š Key Features:

Data preprocessing and feature selection

Model training and evaluation

Comparative analysis of ML algorithms

Interactive visualizations for insights

ðŸ”¬ Tools & Technologies:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)

Google Colab

Jupyter Notebook
